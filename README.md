# ged2csv

The folder "ged2csv" contains scripts used for converting from Gedcom format to a simple CSV format. The Gedcom data was exported from Legacy, to the Gedcom 5.5.1 format, using UTF-8 encoding. The exported data contains some unwanted newlines that make it not readable by Gedcom parsers. It also contains some Dos (Windows) characters that are unreadable in Unix environments such as Linux. So the data was cleaned up with the script "ged_cleanup.sh". Then the script "ged2csv.py" reads the Gedcom data and writes the relevant fields to a CSV file.
